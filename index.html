      <p>Claror is a technical organisation that has released one program so far. It prioritises when you will do your chores, but please remember it is still in development. C2C (or code 2 cope) was created over the period of around 9 months, and over that time, we created a 'masterpiece'. It will give you a sense of organisation.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Please take the survey or we won't know what to change to make it the best experience we can offer to you as a hard-working, law-abiding citizen of today.</p>
   <p>-Thank You</p>
